1) remove monster module import & imports (ngModule) in appmodule (main.ts)monsterCenterRoutes
2) in app.routes add the monster path which uses loadChildren and points to the monsterModule
    -(speak about # for export name)
    - speak about what webpack does here - search for loadChildren in app.bundle.js

3) monsterCenterRoutes - change 'monster' to '' (this is the new 'root' for this child router)
